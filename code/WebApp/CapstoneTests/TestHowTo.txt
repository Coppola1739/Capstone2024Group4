How to set up test reports with fresh package:
	Open NuGet Package Manager and install coverlet.msbuild and ReportGenerator
	In the test directory, run: dotnet tool update -g dotnet-reportgenerator-globaltool
		This will allow you to use the reportgenerator cmd line arg
	Once you build your project and tests, run:
		dotnet test /p:CollectCoverage=true /p:CoverletOutputFormat=opencover
			This will run the tests and show you a terminal view of your coverage report
	Then:
		reportgenerator "-reports:coverage.opencover.xml" "-targetdir:coverage-report" "-reporttypes:HTML"
			This creates a human-readable version of the cover report. To view this:
				open the coverage-report folder
				find index.html
				open with- firefox (or whatever browser you want)


	Eventually this will be scripted.
	Update: this has been scripted for WebApp. To run, just open terminal within the CapstoneTests directory and run:
		.\run-coverage-report.cmd
